Recently Achieved:
Map Page expects the sessionStorage to contain the recycle item category the users have selected. As all other pages are not made yet this is represented by a debug function that sets session storage variables upon entering the page.

Final Page expects the sessionStorage to contain the lat and long of the location the users have selected. This is set by the Map Page upon submit.

Map Page has an input field where you type in an address. Upon submit, it resolves the address and sends a get request to the server for locations with the recycle item category from sesslon storage. It then generates a map with the locations and the start plotted on it. All the locations are also sorted by distance to start. A sidebar is also generated with buttons containing the name, address and opening hours of all the locations. Upon clicking one of the locations on the sidebar, the location marker representing that location on the map will turn red. In addition, a submit button will appear. Upon clicking the submit button the user will be directed to the final page.

At the final page, the google maps QR code will be generated and the comments for that location retrieved.



To test this, I also have a Go server running and SQLite database with a location entry. To run the server, just run the exe.

TODO:
