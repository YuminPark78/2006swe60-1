[Map Page]
Map page has an input field where you type in an address. After submit, it resolves the address and sends a get request to the server for locations. It then generates a map with the locations and the start plotted on it. All the locations are also sorted by distance to start.

To test this, I also have a Go server running and SQLite database with a location entry, it will be pushed in a separate commit.

TODO:
- Utilise session storage to record variables and ensure the get request has a recycle item category. <- working on this
- Make the sidebar
