[Map Page]
Map Page expects the sessionStorage to contain the recycle item category the users have selected. As all other pages are not made yet this is represented by a debug function that sets session storage variables upon entering the page.

Map Page has an input field where you type in an address. Upon submit, it resolves the address and sends a get request to the server for locations with the recycle item category from sesslon storage. It then generates a map with the locations and the start plotted on it. All the locations are also sorted by distance to start.

To test this, I also have a Go server running and SQLite database with a location entry. To run the server, just run the exe.

TODO:
- Create the uri builder for Google Maps/GoQR
- Ensure the MapPage adds session storage and the new Final Page can receive it. <- Jih How working on this
- Create comments section and make it retrieve existing comments
- Settle client encryption key
- Settle login pop up
- Settle the write comments full process.
