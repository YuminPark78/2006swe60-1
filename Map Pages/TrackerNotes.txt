[Map Page]
Map Page expects the sessionStorage to contain the recycle item category the users have selected. As all other pages are not made yet this is represented by a debug function that sets session storage variables upon entering the page.

Map Page has an input field where you type in an address. Upon submit, it resolves the address and sends a get request to the server for locations with the recycle item category from sesslon storage. It then generates a map with the locations and the start plotted on it. All the locations are also sorted by distance to start.

To test this, I also have a Go server running and SQLite database with a location entry. To run the server, just run the exe.

TODO:
- Figure out how to group the locations into groups of ten. <- Jih How working on this
- Make a show more button.
- Make the sidebar
